# offboard_set_points_mavros_python
'''
I am trying to control a drone from the offboard mode using a python script, 
I am new at this so this is my first attempt and I have tried to keep it simple: 
first the drone is armed, then the offboard mode is set, and then a series of positions 
are sent to the drone for it to fly.  At the moments this commands are sent to a 
simulator (jmavsim) connected, and the arming command is working fine, as does the 
offboard mode, but the drone does not move to any positions, so I believe I must be sending those commands incorrectly.
