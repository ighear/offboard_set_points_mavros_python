# offboard_set_points_mavros_python
I am trying to control a drone from the offboard mode using a python script, I am new at this so this is my first attempt and I have tried to keep it simple: first the drone is armed, then the offboard mode is set, and then a series of positions are sent to the drone for it to fly.
